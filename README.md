Levenshtein Distance Calculator 🔤🔍

A full-stack web application to calculate the Levenshtein Distance (edit distance) between two input strings. This project demonstrates string similarity using the classic dynamic programming algorithm, and showcases practical applications like spell checking and autocorrection.

🧠 What is the Levenshtein Algorithm?

The Levenshtein Algorithm calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into another.

Example:

kitten → sitting = 3 edits (k→s, e→i, +g)
